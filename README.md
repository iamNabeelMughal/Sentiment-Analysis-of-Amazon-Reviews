# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Amazon-Reviews
Online reviews play an important role in today’s ecommerce industry. Product comments, ratings, posts etc. have become crucial for a product’s success. People tend to buy products that have more ratings and favorable comments. However, fake reviews can be used to mislead users. Malicious users can post fallacious ratings and comments to any product which may result in degrading its overall ratings and consequentially damaging the customer’s trust. Thus, detecting &amp; classifying these ratings and comments as real or fake has become mandatory for the effectiveness of business opportunities associated with ecommerce industry. A lot of researchers have published different techniques primarily for the detection of fake reviews. Some suggest the use of linguistics while other suggest the use of behavioral analysis.  In this report, we use optimal method for classifying the human sentiments and later the classified the reviews as real or spam. We applied different machine learning algorithms like Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression and Neural Networks on our dataset. This application gave performance results of each algorithm that were measured on the basis of parameters like precision, recall, and f-measure. Finally, a web prototype was developed to showcase the results.
